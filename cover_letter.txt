To whom it may concern,



Recently, I learned of the Dorm for Logan River Academy through Indeed’s website and I am responding with hopes of being considered for this role. With a strong knowledge of your organization's mission and values; education, involvement, compassion, I am confident that my background and commitment will serve well in supporting company progress. As someone who has plenty of experience with working in an environment with children, I would hope to strive towards becoming more involved and aware during my employment there.



I strive to maintain accuracy and consistency in task completion, individual performance, and using acute attention to detail. Additionally, I offer communication and critical thinking. My goal is to apply my ability to work and problem solve independently and my capability of preciseness to support increased efficiency. I also wish to broaden my horizons while I prepare for graduate school.



Please review my attached resume which provides additional details of my education and employment experience. I believe my independence and self efficiency will provide an invaluable asset to your team. I would love for the opportunity to interview and further discuss the position and the ways in which I can positively impact Logan River Academy.



Thank you for your time and consideration.
